# Lab: List Golf

## Summary 

You're working on an existing application
that was built-- for the most part-- by 
drunk children. They have written some very
naive list functions and the unit tests are
failing. 

Your job is to fix the functions in the
ArrayTools.ps1 script so the tests pass.


## Requirements   
1. Tests pass
