# Project Euler #2

## Summary

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a great site 
for honing your programming skills while learning some 
math at the same time.

Here's [problem #2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2):
> Each new term in the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)
> is generated by adding the previous two terms.  
>
> By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
>   1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
>
> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose 
> values do not exceed _four million_, find the _sum_ of the 
> _even-valued_ terms.


## Requirements
1. Get the right output. (I think it's 4613732.)
2. Write tests as time allows.










## Hints
* Here's a naive solution that works well for small numbers:
```
function Get-Term($position){
  if($position -eq 0){
     return 1
  }
  if($position -eq 1){
    return 2
  }
  return (Get-Fibs ($position - 1)) + (Get-Fibs ($position - 2))
}
```
