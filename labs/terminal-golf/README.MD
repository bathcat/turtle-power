# Lab: Terminal Golf

## Summary

These are a few exercises for getting familiar with the Powershell terminal if you've
never used it-- or as a refresher if you have. Try to use the built-in help system, and
rely on Google as a backup plan.
    
## Reqirements
1. Use the help system to find examples of how to use this command: 
    `Invoke-RestMethod`

2. Get a list of processes for VS Code (the application is named `code`)

3. Get a list of Markdown documents (extension: `md`) in this folder and all sub-folders

4. Start an executable-- notepad for instance-- and stop it
  - Stretch goal: Leave the executable up for 10 seconds before stopping it

5. Display the contents of this file: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1322/1322-0.txt 

6. Get all warnings from the **System** event log since the beginning of the month. *Windows only*

7. Create a link on your desktop to your **Documents** folder

8. Set your execution policy to `RemoteSigned`. *Windows only*

9. Set up your profile with a custom welcome banner. Something like this:
    **Hello, Mr. Bloggs. Welcome to Powershell.**
