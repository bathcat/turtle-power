# Lab: Bug-o-War

## Summary
Distracted by their exams, hubris, and copious amounts of alcohol, the interns have introduced a number
of bugs into your Powershell scripts.

## Requirements

There are three scripts, each with unit tests:
* `Get-PassPhrase`
* `Get-Square`
* `Select-Even`

In some cases, failing unit tests indicate what you need to fix. One exception is `Get-Square` where
the unit tests pass, but shouldn't.

Just make the software work and fix unit tests as necessary.
